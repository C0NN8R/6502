# 6502 Emulator

A simple MOS 6502 emulator, based on the 8-bit CPU with 64Kb of memory and adjustable clock speed.

Inspired by the frequent other projects emulating the 6502, probably due to it's simplicity combined with the more advanced instruction set.

# Assembler

The assembler contained in this repository is designed specifically for this emulator, converting very base-level assembly to hexadecimal instruction sets to be read from.
